        <h3>ABCO</h3>
        <p>
            ABCO is an acronym for Active Borrower per Credit Officer, a measure of
            client-staff ratio. It is also known as Case Load.
        </p>

        <h3>Average Loan Size</h3>
        <p>
            Average Loan size represents the client-per-capita loan amount. It is
            calculated as the Loan portfolio divided by the number of clients of an
            MLI.
        </p>

        <h3>Borrowing Cost</h3>
        <p>
            The total charge for taking on a debt obligation that can involve
            interest payments and other financial fees. A percentage of such cost over
            the total amount borrowed indicates the rate of such cost.
        </p>

        <h3>Capital Adequacy Ratio</h3>
        <p>
            Capital Adequacy is the means of measuring the solvency level of MLIs,
            which is an important indicator of the risk-bearing ability of the
            entities. It is the proportion of the capital/own fund held by an MLI
            against its total risk-weighted assets.
        </p>

        <h3>Capital to Total Assets</h3>
        <p>
            Ratio of net worth to total assets.
        </p>

        <h3>Co-lending</h3>
        <p>
            Co-lending is a financial arrangement where two or more lenders work
            together to provide loans to borrowers.
        </p>

        <h3>Debt-Equity Ratio</h3>
        <p>
            Debt-Equity Ratio is the proportion of total debt borrowed to the total
            equity held at a given point of time.
        </p>

        <h3>Debt Funding</h3>
        <p>
            Debt Funding refers to the percentage of the loan portfolio funded by
            outside borrowings.
        </p>

        <h3>External Cost</h3>
        <p>
            External Cost here refers to the Finance cost, which is determined by the
            lending rate of banks and hence is beyond the control of MLIs.
        </p>

        <h3>Finance Cost</h3>
        <p>
            Finance Cost here refers to the interest and other expenses incurred on
            average funds borrowed and outstanding on the books of MLIs. This does
            not include the notional cost of utilizing the equity fund.
        </p>

        <h3>Financial Inclusion</h3>
        <p>
            Financial Inclusion is the delivery of financial services at affordable
            costs to sections of disadvantaged and low-income segments of society.
        </p>

        <h3>Margin</h3>
        <p>
            Margin refers to the difference between the finance cost on the portfolio
            and the total yield on the portfolio. This term is analogous to the
            concept of Net Interest Margin (NIM) widely used in banking parlance.
        </p>

        <h3>Managed Loan Portfolio</h3>
        <p>
            Managed Loan Portfolio is the loan asset originated by MLIs and later
            sold to a third party, like a bank, for augmenting liquidity. The MLIs
            continue to manage these assets (e.g., collecting repayments) on behalf
            of the banks that purchased the portfolio.
        </p>

        <h3>Non-Performing Assets (NPA)</h3>
        <p>
            A debt obligation where the borrower has not honored the repayment
            obligation — either interest or principal or both — to the designated
            lender for a specific period, normally 90 days. The NPA thus yields no
            income to the lender in the form of principal or interest payments.
        </p>

        <h3>Operating Expense Ratio (OER)</h3>
        <p>
            The ratio of staff, travel, administration costs, other overheads, and
            depreciation charges of the MLIs (non-financial costs) to the average
            loan portfolio during a year.
        </p>

        <h3>Operating Self Sufficiency (OSS)</h3>
        <p>
            Operating Self Sufficiency (OSS) shows the sufficiency of income
            (operating income and investment income) earned by MLIs to cover the
            costs — operating cost, loan loss provision, and finance cost — incurred
            to conduct operations.
        </p>

        <h3>Portfolio Quality</h3>
        <p>
            The amount of default risk in the loan portfolio. A high-quality portfolio
            has a lower amount of risk. Portfolio quality changes continually as
            loans are disbursed, payments are made, and payments become due.
        </p>

        <h3>Portfolio at Risk (PAR)</h3>
        <p>
            PAR indicates the proportion of outstanding amounts of all loan accounts
            with past-due/arrears to the total outstanding loan. Generally, PAR 30
            — the part of the portfolio remaining unpaid 30 days or more after the
            due date — is used as a measure to assess portfolio quality. Loans with
            dues crossing PAR 90 are treated as NPA.
        </p>

        <h3>Qualifying Assets</h3>
        <p>
            Qualifying Assets are loan portfolios created by MFIs adhering to certain
            conditions, as prescribed by the RBI, to make the MFIs eligible to be
            called MFIs and to raise loans from banks under the Priority Sector
            Advances Scheme (as per recent RBI norms). For an MFI, 75% of the total
            assets need to be under this category.
        </p>

        <h3>Return on Asset (RoA)</h3>
        <p>
            Return on Asset (RoA) is a universally accepted profitability measure
            representing the net income earned out of the total average assets
            deployed by MLIs over a given period, typically a year.
        </p>

        <h3>Return on Equity (RoE)</h3>
        <p>
            Return on Equity (RoE) is the net income earned out of the average equity
            held by MLIs over a given period.
        </p>

        <h3>Self Help Groups (SHGs)</h3>
        <p>
            SHGs are groups of 10–20 women who form an informal community-based
            institution to meet their common financial and social needs. SHGs collect
            savings and use them for internal lending before accessing higher amounts
            from banks.
        </p>

        <h3>SHG Bank Linkage Programme (SBLP)</h3>
        <p>
            SHGs are linked to mainstream banks for depositing surplus savings of the
            SHGs and to obtain loans. The loan is often granted in proportion to the
            total internal savings accrued in a group. It is considered an effective
            strategy to ensure financial inclusion.
        </p>

        <h3>Surplus</h3>
        <p>
            Surplus is the Yield minus the Total cost.
        </p>

        <h3>Yield on Portfolio</h3>
        <p>
            Yield represents the total income from microcredit operations —
            including interest income, processing fees/service charges — earned from
            the average outstanding loan portfolio. It does not include investment
            income.
