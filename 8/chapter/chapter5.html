          HG – Bank Linkage Programme, launched as a pilot scheme in 1992, by
          NABARD, for linking the poor with a formal banking system, through
          Self Help Groups, have since become a major banking product. RBI
          supported the initiatives through a path-breaking decision in 1991 to
          allow informal groups to open bank account and also avail of credit
          from banks. Thereafter there was no looking back and the scheme grew
          from strength to strength. The RBI supported it with regular policy
          updates. The State and Central governments realised the the strength
          of the SHG movement and adopted it for implementing several
          programmes, mostly targeted on poor. Thus SHG Bank linkage become the
          world’s largest microfinance programme.
    
      </div>

      <p>
        National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM), the world’s largest poverty
        alleviation and employment generation programme, is based on this
        concept. Thus, the SHG Bank linkage programme has earned a place in
        history as one of the most impactful programmes through bank credit. It
        has completed three decades on the Indian financial sector landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
        SHG Bank linkage programme is considered as the first major programme of
        microfinance activity in our country. It is unique to our country where
        the formal banking system and informal structure are leveraging the
        strength of each other for reaching the unreached. Although there had
        been some movement in microcredit, in the country like SEWA Bank, prior
        to this also, they were more localised phenomenon and could not generate
        the kind of impact like SHG BLP. SHG programme is also considered as the
        first initiative of a large-scale financial inclusion process bringing
        the poor under the formal banking fold. Further, it has also helped the
        poor, especially women in their social and financial empowerment.

      <br />
      <p>
        SHG Bank linkage over a three-decade-long journey has grown from
        strength to strength. Although the external events like Covid pandemic
        and demonetization had caused temporary setbacks, it remained more or
        less intact even in such crisis times.
      </p>
      <p>
        Opening of bank accounts for SHGs is the first step in the bank linkage
        programme. The first linkage happens immediately on its formation by
        opening a Savings Bank account for the group. The balance money of
        whatever amount mobilized in the group as regular thrift is deposited in
        these accounts, after using it for internal lending. Thereafter, once
        the group becomes matured, they approach the banks for a credit linkage
        whereby the bank provides credit to the group for on-lending to members.

        As on 31 March 2024, 17.75 crore rural households were savings linked
        under the SHG-BLP through 144.21 lakh SHG bank accounts and transactions
        were carried out. The total savings in these accounts work out to
        ₹65,089.15 crore, registering a growth of 10.52%, over the previous
        year. Of these, 120.44 lakh were all women SHGs with savings of
        ₹55,227.69 crore accounting for nearly 85% of total SHGs linked and
        savings mobilized, respectively. Of the total number of bank accounts
        opened, about 53% have availed of credit from the banking system, thus
        indicating a gap of nearly 47% in credit linkage. This huge gap could be
        due to non-counting of defunct SHGs and their accounts, as the number
        shown is a cumulative number.
      </p>
      <p>
        SHG Bank linkage programme initiated by NABARD in 1992 and spearheaded
        with the help of NGOs and development institutions in the country was
        adopted for the poverty alleviation programmes like Swarnajayanti Gram
        Swarozgar Yojana (SJSY) from 1999 and then National Rural Livelihood
        Mission (NRLM) from 2013 onwards. As a result, most of the SHGs promoted
        through this scheme are under NRLM or related programmes of the
        Government.
      </p>
      <p>
        Presently, the Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Rural Livelihoods
        Mission (DAY-NRLM) under the Ministry of Rural Development, Government
        of India has taken over the formation and capacity building of SHGs in
        rural India. NRLM accounted for 84.30 lakh SHGs and had a growth of 3%
        during the year with a net addition of 2.29 lakh SHGs under its fold.
        Simultaneously, in urban areas, SHG formation and linkage are being
        taken up by the Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Urban Livelihoods
        Mission (DAY- NULM) under the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs,
        Government of India. There are 7.40 lakh SHGs under NULM with a marginal
        growth of 0.01 lakh with a percentage of 0.14% during the year. SHGs are
        predominantly women-focused with 84% of the groups being women SHGs. The
        programme supports the empowerment of the poor rural women in the
        country.
      </p>
      <p>
        SHG BLP has proved to be a strong intervention in economic enablement
        and financial inclusion for the bottom of the pyramid. A proven platform
        initially conceived for increasing the outreach of banking services
        among the poor has since graduated to a programme for the promotion of
        livelihoods, poverty alleviation and social empowerment. All major
        parameters viz. the number of SHGs with savings bank accounts, amount of
        credit disbursed during the year, the bank loans outstanding as well as
        the quantum of savings outstanding had shown positive growth during the
        past few years. The programme has shown steady growth in the past 10
        years, except during the Covid pandemic.

        The growth of SHG-BLP was stable and positive except during the period

        During FY 2023-24, the disbursement to SHGs was at ₹2,09,286 crore, with
        a growth of 44.14% from ₹1,45,200 crore, in the previous year. The
        growth during the previous year was at 45.59%. On the other hand, the
        number of SHGs credit linked during FY 2023-24 has increased to 54.82

      <p>
        Saving is an important component of SHG Bank linkage. The amount saved
        by members in the form of weekly/fortnightly/monthly thrift is used
        mostly for their internal lending. But whatever surplus they have is
        deposited in the Savings Bank account opened in the name of the groups.
        The amount saved and kept in the banking accounts by SHGs also recorded
        steady growth for the past 15 years as can be seen from Figure 5.2. As
        of March 2024, the banking system held SHG savings to the tune of
        ₹65,089 crore with a decent growth of 10.52%.

        The SHGs get bank credit for achieving a certain level of maturity. The
        maturity is assessed based on a rating method and accordingly, credit is
        extended. The NRLM scheme offers interest subvention to the loan availed
        of by the SHGs to a certain level. The amount so borrowed by SHGs is
        mostly disbursed to their members for productive activities, mostly. The
        SHGs also take the responsibility of recovering the loans and repaying
        them to banks. The SHGs availing of bank credit has been growing
        steadily. The year FY 2023-24 registered a 27.61% increase in the number
        of SHGs availing of fresh bank loans, over the previous year. Figure

        SHGs), followed by RRBs with ₹56,833 crore (19.13 lakh SHGs), and
        Cooperative Banks at ₹9,828 crore (2.22 lakh SHGs). Commercial Banks

        Although Union Bank of India had topped in terms of savings mobilized

        year. Figure 5.9 shows that the share of State Bank of India at ₹41,550
        crore was nearly 80% higher than the second position bank i.e. Union
        Bank of India which had a share of ₹24,912 crore and followed by Indian
        Bank with ₹14,807 crore. The seventh and Eighth places are taken by two
        RRB - Saptagiri Grameen Bank at ₹7,117 crore and Dakshin Bihar Gramin
        Bank at ₹6,645 crore. It is significant to note that two RRBs were part

        The recovery of loans through SHGs has been very encouraging. Timely

        show any major spike in NPAs. The overall asset quality in SHG Bank

        While the recovery performance of loans issued by commercial banks and
        Regional Rural Banks was satisfactory, it was low in case of
        cooperatives. The exposure of cooperative banks to SHGs was
        comparatively very low. But the higher NPA with cooperatives indicates
        perhaps the cooperative banks are not following up with SHGs properly.
        They may also lack the expertise to assess the SHG before their linkage.
        The agency- wise asset quality indicates a better position for RRBs,
        followed by Commercial Banks and Cooperative Banks. Figure 5.15 shows
        the NPA levels of SHG loans in different agencies as of 31 March 2024.

        capabilities of the members of SHGs. Through these programmes, NABARD
        provides training to SHG members on skill development, management,
        account keeping and marketing of the commercial units. Most of these
        programmes had entrepreneurship and skill development inputs such as
        achievement motivation training, vocational skills and access to
        information from experts on various aspects of starting an enterprise,
        potential demand and market, finance, branding, packaging,
        advertisement, improving customer management skills etc.

        5.4&nbsp;&nbsp;NABARD’s support for Joint Liability Groups (JLGs) of
        agripreneurs
      </h2>
      <p>
        NABARD introduced a pilot project in 2004-05 primarily to support
        financing of farming communities, especially those who do not have
        sufficient documents to avail of bank credit, by forming them into Joint
        Liability Groups. Such groups are supported for non-farm activities
        activities also. Apart from extending refinance support to banks, NABARD
        also extends grant support to banks and other JLG-promoting agencies for
        the formation and nurturing of JLGs and capacity building of the
        stakeholders. To encourage JLG formation and promotion, NABARD provides
        grant assistance of ₹2,000 per JLG, in the case of NGOs and public
        sector commercial banks acting as JLGPIs and ₹4,000 per JLG in the case
        of RCBs/RRBs/SFBs and private sector banks.
      </p>
      <p>
        A business model scheme was introduced in 2017, whereby banks (PSBs,
        RRBs & Co-operative Banks) execute a MoU with NABARD for financing JLGs
        on terms and conditions as specified in the MoU. During FY 2023-24, a
        total of 73.34 lakh JLGs were promoted as compared to 70 lakh JLGs
        promoted during FY 2022-23. Cumulatively, JLGs promoted stood at 331.26
        lakh as on 31 March 2024 registering a growth of 28% over FY 2022-23. In
        terms of cumulative JLGs promoted as on 31 March 2024, the Western and
        Central regions recorded the highest Y-o-Y growth rate during the FY
        2023-24 at 30.98% and 30.61%, respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the year, the number of JLGs promoted was highest in the Eastern
        region (23 lakh) accounting for 31% of the JLGs financed pan-India
        followed by the Western region @29% (21.2 lakh). As on 31 March 2024,
        the cumulative amount of loans disbursed to JLGs by banks stood at
        ₹6,47,623.85 crore, an increase of 41% from ₹4,59,310.48 crore as on 31
        March 2023. Loan disbursed per JLG, as per the Status of Microfinance in
        India 2023-24, averaged at ₹2.57 lakh per group. The Southern region at
        ₹4.22 lakh per JLG was the highest.

      <p>
        Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihoods Mission
        (DAY-NRLM) is the flagship program of the Ministry of Rural Development
        (MoRD) for promoting poverty reduction through building strong
        institutions for the poor, particularly women, and enabling these
        institutions to access a range of financial services and livelihoods.
        DAY-NRLM adopts a demand-driven approach, enabling the States to
        formulate their own State-specific poverty reduction action plans. The
        blocks and districts in which all the components of DAY-NRLM would be
        implemented, either through the SRLMs or partner institutions or NGOs,
        would be the intensive blocks and districts, whereas the remaining would
        be non-intensive blocks and districts. National Rural Livelihood Mission
        (NRLM) is a restructured version of restructuring Swarnajayanti Gram
        Swarojgar Yojana (SGSY). NRLM was renamed as DAY-NRLM (Deendayal
        Antyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihoods Mission) w.e.f. March 29,
        2016.
      </p>
      <p>
        NRLM has set out with an agenda to cover 7 Crore rural poor households,
        across 600 districts, 6000 blocks, 2.5 lakh Gram Panchayats and 6 lakh
        villages in the country through self-managed Self Help Groups (SHGs) and
        federated institutions and support them for livelihoods collectives in a
        period of 8-10 years. In addition, the poor would be facilitated to
        achieve increased access to their rights, entitlements, and public
        services, diversified risk, and better social indicators of empowerment.
        NRLM believes in harnessing the innate capabilities of the poor and
        complements them with capacities (information, knowledge, skills, tools,
        finance, and collectivization) to participate in the growing economy of
        the country.
      </p>
      <p>
        The National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM), launched on 3rd June 2011
        as a pilot, to provide a sharper focus and momentum for poverty
        reduction as also for achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDG)
        by 2015 by restructuring SGSY. The project was rolled out to entire
        country in 2013.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the year 2023-24, 84.30 lakh SHGs were savings linked to banks under
        NRLM. This represents a growth of 2.79% over the previous year. These
        SHGs had savings to the tune of ₹45,384 crore which is an impressive
        growth of 21.27% over the previous year. Under NRLM, in 2023-24 credit
        was disbursed to 44.89 lakh SHGs, indicating an increase of 28.74% over
        the previous year. The amount disbursed was ₹1,69,797 crore which is a
        sharp surge from ₹1,16,479 crore disbursed in 2022-23, which represents
        a phenomenal increase of 45.78% over the previous year. Similarly, the
        number of NRLM groups which had credit outstanding increased by 10.05%
        to 61.02 lakh groups as on 31 March 2024 The credit outstanding of these
        groups also increased by 37.63% to ₹2,07,138 crore. Figures 5.18, 5.19
        and 5.20 below indicate the progress of SHG linkage under DAY-NRLM.

        5.6&nbsp;&nbsp;Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Urban Livelihoods
        Mission (DAY-NULM)
      </h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        National Urban Livelihoods Mission (NULM) was launched by the Ministry
        of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation (MHUPA), Government of India on
        23rd September 2013 by replacing the existing Swarna Jayanti Shahari
        Rozgar Yojana (SJSRY). The NULM will focus on organizing urban poor in
        their strong grassroots- level institutions, creating opportunities for
        skill development leading to market-based employment and helping them to
        set up self-employment ventures by ensuring easy access to credit. The
        Mission is aimed at providing shelter equipped with essential services
        to the urban homeless in a phased manner. In addition, the Mission would
        also address livelihood concerns of the urban street vendors.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Self-Employment Program (SEP) is one of the components (Component 4)
        of NULM which will focus on providing financial assistance through a
        provision of interest subsidy on loans to support the establishment of
        individual and Group Enterprises and Self-Help Groups (SHGs) of urban
        poor. With a view to improving the livelihood opportunities for the poor
        in urban areas, in 2016 Government of India decided to enhance the scope
        of the National Urban Livelihoods Mission. The Mission with enhanced
        scope has been renamed as Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana -National Urban
        Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM).
      </p>
      <p>
        DAY-NULM envisages universal social mobilisation of the urban poor into
        Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and their federations. At least one member from
        each urban poor household, preferably a woman, is to be brought under
        the Self-Help Group network in a time-bound manner. These groups will
        serve as a support system for the poor, to meet their financial and
        social needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the year 2023-24, 7.40 lakh SHGs were savings linked to banks under
        NULM. This represents a marginal growth of 0.17% over the previous year.
        These SHGs had savings to the tune of ₹4,354 crore which is an
        impressive growth of 22.76% over the previous year. Under NULM, in FY
        2023-24 credit was disbursed to 2.70 lakh SHGs, indicating an increase
        of 36.15% over the previous year. The amount disbursed was ₹13,500 crore
        which is a high from ₹8,627 crore disbursed in FY 2022-23, which
        represents an increase of 56.48% over the previous year. Similarly, the
        number of NULM groups which had credit outstanding increased by 15.29%
        to 3.94 lakh groups as on 31 March 2024 The credit outstanding of these
        groups also increased by 38.24% to ₹15,314 crore.

      </h2>
      <p>
        GoI launched the Lakhpati Didi Scheme on 15 August 2023 with the
        objective of graduating 2 crore mature SHG women as individual
        micro-entrepreneurs through credit linkage as ‘Lakhpati Didis’. This
        target has since been revised by NRLM to cover 3 crore SHG women.
      </p>
      <p>
        Till date, 6,611 master trainers and 3.64 lakh CRPs (Community Resource
        Persons) have been trained and 1.84 lakh potential lakhpati didis
        identified from across 34 states/742 districts.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Women Enterprise Acceleration Fund (WEAF) is also set up by NRLM which
        includes (i) reimbursement of credit guarantee fees (covered under
        CGTMSE and CGFMU) to banks on microenterprise loans up to ₹5 lakh for a
        maximum period of 5 years given to women entrepreneurs from SHG network
        and (ii) 2% interest subvention on enterprise loan outstanding up to
        ₹1.5 lakh per borrower given to such women borrowers, based on prompt
        repayments to incentivize good repayment behaviour.
      </p>
      <p>
        NRLM is also gaining support from other funding institutions in helping
        this programme to get traction and achieve the desired results. As a
        result, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) has taken the
        responsibility in 7 states viz. Assam, West Bengal, Jharkhand,
        Chattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Gujarat, where the SHG members
        will identified, trained, and handheld for setting up or scaling up of
        their activities and become a Lakhpati didi. Sa-Dhan is the partner in
        these 7 states of which four have been already grounded.

        <p>
          Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and Joint Liability Groups (JLGs) have been
          instrumental in promoting financial access for economically
          marginalized women in India. The SHG-Bank Linkage Program enabled
          around 16 crore households to be formally linked to banks through
          Savings linkage and has nearly 10 crore households linked through
          credit linkage and availed of around ₹2.60 lakh crore of bank credit
          as on 31 March 2024. Although many of these SHG members have utilized
          their loan amount for some economic activities, most of them remain
          unable to scale to bigger enterprises.
        </p>
        <p>
          Data from the Ministry of MSME highlights that women-owned enterprises
          remain significantly underrepresented in India, with only 20.4% in
          microenterprises, 5.3% in small enterprises, and just 2.7% in
          medium-sized enterprises. The primary constraint is the lack of
          training, handholding and access to larger credit. The banks prefer to
          lend to the smaller borrowers through group mode, where scaling up of
          an enterprise is not possible
        </p>
        <p>
          The Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Rural Livelihood Mission
          (DAY-NRLM) aims to uplift women economically. With over 90 million
          women across 77 million SHGs, around 10 million women are ready for
          individual loans ranging from ₹75,000 to ₹1 million. But the SHGs
          members lack the appropriate support system and financial products to
          meet these needs. This bottleneck hampers their growth, limiting their
          potential for larger enterprises.

          To address these challenges, Sa-Dhan sought funding from the Gates
          Foundation to provide Technical Assistance (TA) to DAY-NRLM’s
          enterprise financing initiative. The three-year project, launched in

          Bengal, and Assam.

          This TA aims to help 1 million women entrepreneurs access formal
          financing from banks, Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), Small Finance Banks

          Sa-Dhan has deployed dedicated state and district-level teams in the
          four project states, and has collaborated with M2i Consulting (as the
          Technical Agency) and LEAD-KREA (for Monitoring & Evaluation). By
          August 2024, training programs for Vitta Sakhis, SRLM officials, and
          women entrepreneurs have been conducted across all states, resulting
          in nearly 2,000 individuals being trained. These efforts have
          facilitated the sourcing and submission of over 8,000 individual loan
          applications at the branch level. Additionally, technological tools,
          including Business Plan software and loan application tracking
          systems, have been developed to streamline the loan application
          process.

          Sa-Dhan has been collaborating with banks, including developing a
          Common Loan Application format in partnership with the Indian Banks’
          Association (IBA) to simplify the loan process. State-level Bankers’
          conclaves were held to improve coordination between banks and SRLMs.
          Efforts are underway to address bottlenecks in loan sanctions, delays,
          and awareness gaps about enterprise finance for women.

          The Lakhpati Didi scheme is a program by the Ministry of Rural

              <li>
                Financial success: The scheme provides financial instruments to
                help women access credit, start businesses, and become
                financially independent.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: none">
              <li>
                Sustainable livelihoods: The scheme promotes sustainable
                livelihood practices and diversified activities.
              </li>
            </ol>

                Decent standard of life: The scheme aims to help women achieve a
                decent standard of life.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The ultimate aim of the scheme is to ensure atleast an income of
          Rupees one lakh for a poor household. The initiative of Sa-Dhan along
          with BMGF is an effort towards this programme of GOI.
        </p>
        <h3 id="conclusion">6. Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          This project tackles the critical barriers preventing women-led
          enterprises from accessing formal finance. Through Sa-Dhan’s TA,
          substantial progress has been made, but more work is required to fully
          realize the project’s goals of empowering women entrepreneurs under
          the NRLM framework.
