          uman resources is the greatest asset of any institution. Especially in
          a high-touch business activity like microfinance, the human resource
          and its quality plays an important role. With a large number of field
          staff, more than 60%, involved in acquisition of clients, appraisal of
          their loan application, collection of repayment amount etc. the key
          success of an institution lies on their quality, continuance and
          productivity. The sector is also slowly adopting technology and
          innovative practices wherever possible, making it more efficient and
          quicker. However, the basic services still predominantly depend on
          human resources for ensuring effective delivery.
      </div>
      
      <p>
        In microfinance sector, the predominant practice is to lend through
        groups of customers, where each one guarantees for all, through joint
        liability concept. This model was developed more than 30 years back and
        it still continues to be the most efficient and effective one, although
        in the recent days there has been some dilution in the concept. But it
        is still the strongest one. Well-functioning groups and centre meetings
        can help in bringing down cost of operation for the MLIs as the sourcing
        and collection be on an aggregated mode, and the personnel cost, which
        contribute substantially to the total expenses of MLIs, can be
        economized. It can also enhance staff productivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The staff productivity is measured through some key indicators such as
        active borrowers per credit officer (ABCO), active borrowers per MLI
        staff (ABS), amount of loan outstanding per credit officer etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the growth in the microfinance sector, there has been a steady
        growth of workforce also. As on 31st March 2024, the total workforce in
        MLIs stood at 2.87 lakh, with a growth of 33% over the previous year.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following graphs in Figure 4.1.1, illustrates three aspects, the
        growth of manpower in MLIs over the years and the distribution of staff
        between the type and size of entities.
      </p>

            78% of the total workforce is employed with NBFC-MFIs. MLIs having
            outstanding portfolio of ₹2,000 Cr. and above employ 80% of the
            total workforce.

        More than sixty per cent of the staff in MLIs are in the field, working
        as branch staff, involved in business activities like sourcing,
        appraising, lending and collection. The share of women employees is
        comparatively less and constitutes only around 11% of the total
        workforce of MLIs and most of them are based in administrative offices.

        In FY 2023-24, the share of Field Staff increased to 64% with a small
        increase from 63% in the previous year.
      </p>
      <p>
        The share of women staff in MLIs has been stagnating around 10%.
        Although there was a higher number of upto 19% at one point of time, the
        share came done with growth in business and addition of more field
        staff.

        The microfinance sector provides a lot of job opportunities for the
        young educated persons in villages and semi-urban areas. Since being a
        manpower-intensive industry, there is a huge scope for new employment in
        MLIs. Above that, the higher level of attrition due to higher aspiration
        of the people leads to more opportunities in the sector.

            MLIs are a major provider of jobs especially in rural areas. In FY
            23-24, a total of 1.69 lakh staff have been recruited, there is
            growth of 36% over last year.

      <br />
      <p>
        During FY 2023-24, around 60% of the total staff were recruited afresh.
        This is due to - (i) the growth in business leading to the need for
        fresh staff which is a welcome step, and (ii) higher attrition of staff
        leading to fresh recruitment, which may not be very desirable fact.
        While some kind of attrition of staff is expected and desirable, the
        level of attrition now being witnessed in the industry is not a good
        sign. The reasons for increased level of attrition of staff are due to,
        (i) movement of staff to other institutions, especially with a number of
        new players entering into microfinance sector, (ii) the inability to
        cope up with tough rigors of microfinance industry (iii) higher
        aspirational levels of the staff (iv) opportunities offered by other
        industries
      </p>
      <p>
        (v) looking for better work life balance Table 4.1.2 shows, a total of
        1.69 lakh fresh staff were recruited by the MLIs during year, which
        forms 59% of the total strength of staff at 2.87 lakhs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Table 4.1.2 give the attrition in MLIs during FY 2023-24. The
        attrition varied between the organization from single digit to even
        100%. The higher exit of staff from the MLI leading to fresh recruitment
        and training will involve higher operational costs for the MLIs.

        As per the field-level feedback attrition has gone up significantly and
        above does not seems to reflect the same. It could be some error in data
        collection. The previous attrition had touched at 49% and in the
        reporting year, it could be more. An estimation indicates 60% attrition
        in the industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        NBFC-MFIs were the largest recruiters of staff with nearly 82% staff
        during last year. This is mainly due to their share in the total
        business growth during the year. The Non-Profit MFIs with lesser share
        in the business were able to retain most of their staff and hence the
        staff attrition was lower in these institutions, indicating that there
        is a better connect between staff and their organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Equifax India has developed an employee bureau which enables the
        MLIs to register the details of the staff recruited and those leaving
        the organization, with details of the behaviour of the staff and their
        conduct. The prompt use of this facility can prevent the frequent
        movement of staff and also avoid recruiting erring staff who have left
        on account of disciplinary cases. A verification of staff details from
        the Bureau will help prevent any wrong person from joining the MLI,
        provided all the MLIs use this facility and also upload the data timely.

      <p>
        The staff productivity is generally measured as a ratio of active
        borrowers to staff. The ABCO measures the number of active borrowers
        served by a Credit Officer (CO) and ABS measures active borrowers per
        staff of MLI, which includes all staff of the organisation. The ABCO
        number is significant as it determines the quantity and quality of time
        spent by the credit officer with a borrower, indicating his/her quality
        of service and productivity. With a lower ABCO ratio, the staff may be
        able to provide better service, but at a higher cost to the MLIs.
        Similarly, a very high ABCO ratio, although in terms of business, may
        look better, it can affect the quality of service and cause higher work
        burden to the staff. A proper ratio means it will able to provide better
        service and a better productivity to the company. Moreover, it will
        result in better quality of work for the staff.
      </p>
      <p>
        Diversity in the microfinance industry is also reflected in staff
        productivity levels among different MLIs. Figure 4.1.4 depicts the staff
        productivity ratios measured through Active Borrowers per Staff member
        (ABS) and Active Borrower per Credit Officer (ABCO). The staff ratio
        indicates that about 21% of MLIs have less than 100 borrowers per staff
        member, 38% have 100-200 borrowers per staff, 19% have 200-250 borrowers
        per staff, 9% have 250-300 borrowers per staff, 6% have 300-400
        borrowers per staff, and 7% have more than 400 borrowers per staff.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, 25% of MLIs have ABCO less than 200 borrowers, 26% of MLIs
        have ABCO between 200 to 300 borrowers, 21% of MLIs have ABCO between
        300 to 400 borrowers, 13% of MLIs have ABCO between 400 to 500
        borrowers, and 15% of MLIs have ABCO above 500 borrowers. There are 9
        MLIs having ABCO above 1000 which indicates that there are unrealistic
        work expectations from field staff in these institutions which can lead
        to poor portfolio quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ratio can also vary from geography based on the population and
        terrain. The MLIs needs to arrive at a reasonable number based on the
        area services and ensure better services to the client and better
        efficiency to the institution.

        The average ABCO for 2024 stands at 380 for the whole industry, as
        against 391 in FY 2022-23. ABCO for Private & Public Limited Companies
        was the lowest among all types of institutions, at 272. The average of
        Not-for-Profit MFIs had the highest ratio at 588, due to use of SHG
        delivery model by some large MLIs like SKDRDP, followed by NBFCs (476).
        ABCO seems to be increasing with the scale of operations.

        4.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Distribution of MLIs Based on Loan Portfolio per Credit
        Officer
      </h2>
      <p>
        In addition to the number of clients serviced by credit officers, the
        amount of loans handled by them is also an important measure that
        contributes to staff productivity. Figure 4.1.7 presents the
        distribution of MLIs across various bands of loan portfolio handled by
        each credit officer. About 12% of MLIs have credit officers handling a
        loan portfolio of less than ₹20 lakh, 11% of MLIs have a range of ₹20-40
        lakh loan portfolio per credit officer, 15% of MLIs have a range of
        ₹40-60 lakh loan portfolio per credit officer, 16% of MLIs have a range
        of ₹60-80 lakh loan portfolio per credit officer, 11% of MLIs have a
        range of ₹80-100 lakh loan portfolio per credit officer, and 35% of MLIs
        have loan officers handling a portfolio worth more than ₹100 lakh.
      </p>
      <p>
        The amount handled by the Credit Officer will also depend on the stage
        of JLG/SHG in his/her area of operation and the size of loan being
        disbursed. So long as there are proper remittance facilities available
        or switching to digital repayment, it may not be of great concern.
        However, any case of excess loan accounts can impact the quality of
        service and collection efficiency.

        4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Asset Quality in MLIs
      </h2>
      <p>
        The loan portfolio is the most important asset on the books of an MLI.
        As per the definition of micro finance institution, at least 75% of the
        total assets has to be micro credit, which means non collateral loans
        lend to a poor household of less than ₹3 lakh annual income. The
        non-loan asset in a typical MLI is very limited. As a result, the
        quality of loan portfolio is very crucial for the viability and
        sustainability of an MLI.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the loan extended by the MLI is through the group model, mostly
        Joint Liability Groups, taking the advantage of peer pressure and the
        principles of joint liability within the group, which ensures timely
        repayment. This model had been very successful so far in maintaining
        near 100% recovery, except for some unforeseen external events, and
        thereby ensuring a good quality of loan asset. This has been time tested
        and proven model in the past two and half decades, and helped to beat
        the huge concentration risks, the industry is laden with.
      </p>
      <p>
        The portfolio quality of Indian MLIs has always been healthy, except
        during the periods of some external events like false propaganda by
        vested parties, or natural calamities or one-off events like
        demonetization in 2016, and Covid-19 pandemic. The overall PAR for the
        MLI sector has been very low in most of the period in the last 6 years,
        as can be seen in Figure 4.2.1. The Covid-19 pandemic had disrupted the
        sector completely causing huge loan defaults which resulted in higher
        PAR>30 or 30 +dpd of 8.35% in FY 2021-22. The collections improved since
        then bringing the PAR> 30 down to 3.47% in FY 2022-23, and 2.85% in FY
        2023-24. But still, it is yet to reach pre covid period level. The PAR>
        30 or Portfolio at Risk above 30 days is counted all overdue amount
        including overdue above179 days. The overdues above 179 days is counted
        separately, which is a general industry practice, and it is fully
        provided as per RBI guidelines and even written off from the books.

        Distribution of MLIs as per various levels of PAR shows (Figure 4.2.2)
        that over 43% of MLIs have PAR &lt;1% for 30 days, 31% of MLIs have PAR
        in the range of 1-3%, 14% of MLIs have PAR in the range of 3-5%, 8% of
        MLIs have PAR in the range of 5-10%, 4% of MLIs have a PAR of more than
        10%.
      </p>
      <p>
        The weighted average values of the sector of PAR> 30 days, PAR> 60 days,
        PAR> 90 days, and PAR> 180 days for FY 2018-19, FY 2019-20, FY 2020-21,
        FY 2021-22, FY 2022-23, and FY 2023-24 are indicated in Figure 4.2.3
        which shows that that portfolio quality in all buckets has improved in
        FY 2023-24 since FY 2021-22.

        Another important indicator of portfolio quality is overdue installments
        beyond 180 days. The pending installment amount is ₹ 2,792 Cr. as of
        March 2024, which is lower compared to March 2023 (₹ 3,070 Cr.). The
        significance of this amount is that the MLIs concerned ought to make
        100% provision in the balance sheet as per RBI’s prudential norms and it
        is fully provided for. Any recovery against that will improve the bottom
        line.

        institutions have given their data which will definitely give some

        4.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure Analysis
      </h3>
      <p>
        During the year 2023-24, a total expense incurred by the 165 MLIs that
        reported their data is at ₹26,037 Cr. The total expenses would have been
        more if all the 217 MLIs’ data were received. The expenses reported
        include operating cost i.e. personnel cost + administrative cost + loan
        loss provisions + other expenses and financial expenses (mainly cost of
        borrowings).
      </p>
      <p>
        The ratio of Loan Loss Provisions (LLP) to Operating Expenses during
        2023-24 showed a decreased to 23% from 28% in the previous year. This is
        mainly due to the improvement in the operations of the MLIs and reduced
        write-offs made by the MLIs, as the effects of covid have subsided.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Figure 4.3.1 gives the total expenses reported by the MLIs. The
        major component of Expenditure of an MLI is due to its financial cost
        incurred, as the working funds for MLIs is borrowed from various

        The Figure 4.3.2 above indicates the proportion of financial, personal
        and other expenses including administrative expenses of different types
        of MLIs. The financial expenses for Private & Public Limited Companies
        are less because all the Private & Public Limited Companies are working
        as exclusive Business Correspondents (BC) with various banks or
        Financial Institutions. Similarly, most of the Section 8 Companies have
        substantial BC portfolio and may have also sourced external funds in a
        limited quantity, as they mostly operated with their own portfolio.
        Whereas the smaller MLIs, covered under others, have sourced funds
        mostly from NBFCs at higher rates and hence have a higher proportion of
        financial expenses. The Chapter 7, give more details about the BC
        portfolio and it has seen that the BC portfolio has grown over the
        years. There are 20 MLIs (including 16 Private and Public Ltd.
        Companies) that have adopted the exclusive BC route for lending.

        The major component of the Operating Cost is the manpower cost, which
        include wages and other staff expenses. As microfinance is a high-touch
        activity the number of staff involved in the operation is very high. It
        forms 49% of the operating cost. The operating cost is 54% of total
        expenditure of the 165 MLIs which provided their data. The loan
        provision forms about 23% and the balance 28% is the administrative cost
        and other expenses. The Other expenses in operational cost are also
        significant, as can be seen from Figure 4.3.2. The cost incurred for
        technological and process upgradation is mostly included under this
        head, adding to the operational cost.

        mostly operated as BCs had the OC at 7.52% and NBFCs was the highest at
        8.25%. In addition to the legal form, Figure 4.3.3 also shows a inverse

        The Financial Cost is the Cost of borrowing/raising funds from market.
        It includes the rate of interest on borrowing and other charges and
        fees, if any, for raising the funds. The average cost of funds of the
        MLIs has to be worked out taking the amount of cash outflow on account
        of raising funds, including various costs and charges, over the total
        amount raised by all MLIs, as a percentage. Since this data is not
        readily available it could not be worked out. However, the weighted

        Figure 4.4.6 indicates the weighted average values of ROE and ROA for
        all types of MLI size-wise. The very large MLIs with outstanding
        portfolios over ₹2,000 Cr. had the highest ROA and ROE at 4.27% and
        20.73%, respectively, while smaller MLIs with outstanding portfolio less
        than ₹100 Cr. had ROA at 1.88% and ROE at 7.92% respectively.

      <p>
        A balance sheet is a statement of accounts that contains the details of
        a company’s assets and liabilities, at a point of time. It mirrors the
        strength of an organisation. A strong balance sheet gives an edge to the
        company in raising funds. As the MLIs depend largely on external funding
        for their business and capital needs, have to have a healthy balance
        sheet. This section analyses the balance sheet structure of MLIs and

        The total assets of the 209 MLIs, for which data is available, were at
        ₹2,21,880 Cr. at the end of FY 2023-24, with an increase of ₹73,402 Cr.
        over the previous year, recording a growth rate of 49%.
      </p>
      <p>
        The trend analysis indicates that the total assets of MLIs have been
        growing steadily in past years, except in the year FY 2016-17, when
        there was a sharp decline of 21% due to the after-effects of
        demonetisation. The graduation of some of the bigger MLIs to banks also
        contributed to this dip.

        Loans constitute the major assets of an MLI. The total loan portfolio
        formed about 82% of the total assets, in respect of 209 MLIs, who have
        shared the data, as on 31 March 2024. This was followed by cash and cash
        equivalents at 7%. The cash or cash equivalents formed a significant
        chunk due to reasons like receipt of large quantum of debt funding
        towards the end of the financial year, retaining cash for meeting their
        repayment liabilities for the next month and the FLDG/Margin maintained
        for the purpose of sourcing funds. However, the MLIs have been cautioned
        to reduce this as it can distort the qualifying assets calculation as
        per the new regulatory framework. The various components of the balance
        sheet are discussed below.

        of the overall portfolio, the total Net Owned Funds (NOF) stood at
        ₹37,525 Cr. for the year 2023-24. This NOF is comprised of paid-up
        equity, share premium, retained earnings, and other reserves. Almost the
        entire amount is contributed by the ‘For-profit’ MFIs i.e., NBFC-MFIs
        and NBFCs which forms 99% share of the aggregate NOF.

        The ‘For-profit’ entities (NBFCs/NBFC-MFIs) held more than 98% of the

      </h3>
      <p>
        Raising debt for lending is one of the major activities of a typical
        MLI. There are different sources of raising debt funds. But the main
        source is through borrowing from FIs and Banks. The debt funds raised by
        the MLIs showed an increase during the year. At the end of 2023-24,
        there was a growth of 47% in debt outstanding, compared to the previous
        year.
      </p>
      <p>
        Based on the data reported by 132 MLIs, which formed above 80% of total
        loan portfolio of the sector, the total outstanding of debt funds in
        MLIs stood at ₹1,30,096 Cr., as on 31 March 2024. Of the remaining MLIs,
        56 did not receive funds from any source, 20 MLIs were working as
        exclusive BC agents of various banks/ financial institutions, and 9
        MLIs, which had received substantial funds, did not share the details of
        funding received by them. Although this data is not complete, it gives a
        trend in funding received.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of this funding received by MLIs during the year was through
        borrowing (75%). About 10% of funds were raised through Non-Convertible
        Debentures. The subordinated debt and ECB also formed sources of funding
        for MLIs. Some of the cooperative institutions, which have the option to
        raise funds through deposits and savings from borrowers/members, also
        mobilize the funds through that source. Another source of funding was
        through Securitization and sale of portfolio. About 34 MLIs have raised
        funds to the tune of ₹17,569 Cr. through securitisation, in FY 2023-24.
        A break up of various sources of debt funding enjoyed by MLI during FY
        2023-24 is given in Figure 4.5.6

        Cr. Figure 4.5.7 indicates that of the borrowing, private sector banks’
        share was at 39%, followed by public sector banks at 21%, NBFCs at 9%,

        remaining, the MLIs with portfolio between ₹500 Cr. to ₹2,000 Cr. had 7%
        and MLIs with portfolio of ₹100 Cr. to 500 Cr. had 2% share. Smaller
        MLIs with total portfolio below ₹100 Cr., could only raise 1% share of

      <p>
        As per the RBI regulatory norms, NBFC-MFIs need to maintain at least 15
        percent of their risk-weighted assets in the form of capital. Although
        there are no such stipulations for other legal forms, it is desirable to
        hold capital at par with NBFC-MFIs. The Capital Adequacy of Indian MLIs,
        by and large, is well above the prescribed norms. The Figure 4.5.11
        indicates the estimated average CRAR of the various types of
        institutions. The median CAR for 2023-24 stood at 26.77%.
      </p>
      <p>
        NBFC-MFIs, for which maintaining capital adequacy is mandatory, had an
        industry-wide average CAR of 27.21% in aggregate, while Private & Public
        Limited companies had the highest CAR of 33.38%. This was mainly on
        account of the fact that Private and Public. Ltd. companies were working
        as Business Correspondents (BC) with various banks and financial
        institutions and hence the risk-weighted assets on their books are
        minimal.

        The MLIs borrow from banks on the strength of their capital, they hold.
        The leverage is generally understood as a multiple of their own capital
        to the borrowings they have from outside sources including banks. Debt-
        Equity Ratio is the parameter considered for measuring the extent of
        leveraging of equity to raise outside debt. The leverage needs to be
        optimum to balance between the profitability and stability of MLIs.
