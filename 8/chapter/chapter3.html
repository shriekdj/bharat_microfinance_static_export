          he growth and spread of microfinance are measured in terms of number
          of clients and amount of loan portfolio. Considering the vastness of
          the country and the population, the growth has to be steady and quick
          to reach everyone and everywhere in a quick pace. This is also the
          objective of the financial inclusion that our policy makers are
          planning for. Microfinance sector has been at the forefront in this
          objective and have been growing steadily in the past few years except
          for a couple of years of pandemic and other crisis
        </div>
      <p>
        Microfinance lenders, including Micro Lending Institutions (MLIs), have
        operations in all the 36 States/UTs in India. Although the growth and
        expansion are not uniform across the geography, the MLIs have been able
        to make some presence in all the States/ UTs in the country.
      </p>
      <p>
        This chapter is prepared based on the detailed information collected
        directly from 217 Micro Lending Institutions (MLIs) (which includes
        NBFC-MFIs, NBFCs, Sec.8 Coms, Societies, Trusts, MACS or Cooperatives,
        Pvt. & Pub. Ltd. Coms and excludes Banks and SFBs) operating in the
        country which gives the geographical distribution of microfinance
        institutions and their client outreach, in the first part, and the
        issues of loan outstanding, loan disbursement and purpose of loans, in
        the second part.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most part of this chapter is based on the analysis of the data collected
        from these 217 Micro Lending Institutions (MLIs) which excludes Banks
        and SFBs, which also lend under microfinance segment.
      </p>

      <h2 style="font-size: x-large" id="geographical_spread_of_microfinance">
        3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Geographical Spread of Microfinance
      </h2>

      <p>
        Based on the data reported by 217 MLIs, which cover more than 98% of MLI
        portfolio, MLIs operate in all 28 States, 5 Union Territories, and 723
        districts in India. This data is in little variance with the data
        presented in Chapter 2, which have been sourced from Credit Information
        Company (CIC), where the operations of MLIs is reported in 36 States/UTs
        and 719 districts. This variation could be due to the fact that some of
        the BC partners operating on behalf of Banks/FIs, may also have been
        reported as part of their area of operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Table 3.1, shows the distribution of MLIs by State/UT they operate.
        The data presented is the number of MLIs operating in single or multiple
        states/UTs with comparative position of the previous year. Annexure 1
        indicates the State/UT wise presence of different MLIs and SFBs across
        the country.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further analysis shows that during FY 2023-24, there are 25 MLIs which
        had operations in more than ten States/UTs, out of which 20 MLIs are
        operating in more than fifteen States/UTs. Whereas, 89 MLIs had
        operations confined to a single State/UT, as against 101 in the previous
        year. Another 103 MLIs operated in 2 to 10 States/UTs. The details of
        States/Union Territories-wise of MLI operations are given in Table 3.1.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: small">
        <sup>1</sup>
        Some of these districts may not have active presence of MLIs at present
        as they may have exited. But they have been able to reach these
        districts at one time or other.

        The number of States/UTs have almost remained the same for the past two
        years, with little variations in certain categories. The larger MLIs,
        mostly NBFC-MFIs had spread out their operations to more States/ UTs.
        Whereas the smaller MLIs, especially those in the category “Not for
        Profit” category, remained mostly confined to one or two states only.
        These institutions maintained their regional focus in their operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        A list of top 10 MLIs operating in terms of number of States/UTs and
        districts are presented in Figure 3.1 and Figure 3.2, respectively. The
        Figure 3.1 shows that Satin had operations in 26 States/UTs, which was
        the maximum. This was followed by Asirvad and Satya having operations in
        25 States/UTs each.

        The microfinance serves the financial needs of the poor and needy who
        finds difficult to raise funds from main stream banking sources. Also,
        the microfinance provides the credit in a hassle-free manner with a door
        step service. This benefits the borrowers at the bottom of the pyramid
        and therefore most of the MLIs were able to attract a large client base,
        especially the larger ones, which runs to several thousands and
        millions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The active client base of the MLIs in FY 2024 has increased to 698 lakhs
        from the previous year position of 532 lakhs, posting a Y-o-Y growth of
        31%. However, if the client base of NBFCs and BC Companies are excluded
        and only consider the client base of pure MFIs category (NBFC-MFIs,
        Societies, Sec.8 Coms, Trust, MACS or Cooperatives), then the client
        base is 565 lakhs with a Y-o-Y growth of active clients is 15%. Here too
        there is an aberration. Till last year, the data for all microfinance
        institutions including NBFCs and BC companies were combined together.
        From this year onwards the data is segregated to give a better

        The Figure 3.5 indicates the growth trend of active borrowers over past
        decade. It can be seen the number has more than doubled in the last 10
        years from 330 lakhs in 2014 to 698 lakhs in 2024. The majority of these
        clients are serviced by NBFC-MFIs (75%), and another 14% by NBFCs. The
        other institutions (Society/ Trust/MACS or Cooperatives) and BC
        companies has 6% and 5%, respectively. A minute share of 0.4% was by
        Sec. 8 Companies (0.4%). Similarly, MLIs with outstanding portfolio over

        NBFC-MLIs were leading with 138 lakh new borrowers accounting for 74% of
        total new borrowers. Similarly, 25 very large MLIs with GLP&gt;₹2,000
        Cr. added 150 lakhs, constituting 80% of the total new borrowers. The
        total active borrowers outstanding with MLIs at the end of FY 2024 was
        at 698 lakhs as against 532 lakhs in the previous year. However, many of
        the new borrowers reported by MLIs in this chapter may not be new to
        credit, but new to the institution lending during the year.

      </h3>
      <p>
        The regional spread of microfinance is not uniform. Initially it was
        more concentrated in southern states. Slowly eastern region caught up
        and took the top position. But other regions are still lagging behind.
      </p>
      <p>
        The data for FY 2023-24 show that, out of the total active client base
        of 698 lakhs, Eastern region led with 30%, followed closely by Southern
        region with 29%, Central region with 22% and Western and Northern region
        with 9% each. North Eastern region had the least active clients with 1%
        share. The expansion of client base during the year shows that Eastern
        region increased from 29% to 30% and Central region from 21% to 22%.
        Whereas, the Southern region reported a decline in the share from 30% to
        29% and for North Eastern region from 2% to 1%. The shares of Western
        (9%) and Northern (9%) region remained unchanged.

        The States/UTs wise client base is mapped in Table 3.3. It is observed
        that all States/UTs have experienced a positive growth, except for
        Chandigarh, Manipur and Tripura. The major states in terms of portfolio
        which have experienced higher positive growth are Bihar, Uttar Pradesh,
        Jharkhand, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Odisha etc. Notably,
        Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have recorded significant increase in
        client outreach due to entry of several MLIs in these states after a
        favorable Court order.

        The growth in base in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh recorded a sharp increase
        by 39% and 36%, respectively. As the states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar
        have lower banking presence, this space is being filled by these MLIs,
        which will help in advancing the financial inclusion agenda of the
        country. Other major states in terms of number of clients under the fold
        of MLIs were Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh which recorded
        19%, 28% and 26% growth, respectively.

      <h3 id="rural_–_urban_share_of_mlis_borrowers">
        3.3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rural – Urban Share of MLIs Borrowers
      </h3>
      <p>
        MLIs serve both rural and urban poor. In Latin America as also in large
        parts of Africa and Asia, the micro finance is an urban based
        phenomenon. Whereas, in India it was oriented more towards rural areas.
        In India too, the urban borrowers had dominated for a while. With the
        transformation of some of the then bigger MLIs into banks, the
        proportion has taken a change. Presently the share is entirely tilted
        towards rural clientele with 77% of clients from rural areas. This
        increase in rural share goes well with the composition of India’s
        population which still dominated by rural people, at around 70%. The
        smaller sized of MLIs were generally rural centric, although there were
        a few catering to only urban areas.

        SC/ST, and Minorities)
      </h3>
      <p>
        Microfinance is a predominantly woman focused activity. World over,
        women are the focus of microfinance. In India too, woman clients
        constitute 99% of the total clients of MLIs. Further, it also serves
        other weaker and marginalized sections like Scheduled Castes, Scheduled
        Tribes and Minorities in a large way. The, SC/ ST borrowers constitute a
        substantial chunk of 25% of the clients. A trend analysis of women
        borrowers, SC/ST borrowers and minority borrowers is shown in the
        following Table 3.4. This clearly shows the social outlook these
        institutions, many of them had their beginning as NGOs serving the
        vulnerable sections. The data for borrowers having personal Bank A/c and
        borrowers having BPL Card has been also captured from FY 2016-17.

      <h3>3.4.i &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loan Portfolio of MLIs</h3>
      <p>
        The MLIs extend loans to the poorer households who find it difficult to
        access credit from other sources including mainstream banking and
        financial institutions. The credit needs of the borrowers ranges from
        emergency loans, consumption loans, small business loans, working
        capital loans, housing loans etc. which they find difficult to access
        from main stream players on account of lack of security, smaller size of
        loans and hassles around getting the loan. MLIs have stepped into this
        space and have been doing a yeoman service in supporting the financially
        excluded. The GOI has recognized this and have made MLIs especially the
        NBFC-MFIs and NBFCs to be the partners of two flagship programmes viz.
        Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) and PM SVANidhi. MLIs contribute
        around 40% of the Shishu loans under PMMY.
      </p>
      <p>
        As on March 2024, the total loan outstanding of MLIs has reached
        ₹2,61,239 Cr. with a growth of 45%, which includes the microfinance book
        of NBFCs and BC companies also. If this is removed, the loan outstanding
        of the pure MFIs alone (NBFC-MFIs, Societies, Sec.8 Coms, Trust, MACS or
        Cooperatives), recorded 28% growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Asset Under Management (AUM) of MLIs include the off-balance sheet
        assets like Assigned & Securitized book and BC Portfolio, which
        aggregated to to ₹79,410 Cr., constituting 30% of the Gross Loan
        Portfolio. Out of the Off-Balance Sheet Portfolio, BC portfolio alone is
        ₹54,416 Cr. The Net Loan Portfolio or Own Portfolio on the books of the
        MLIs stood at ₹1,81,829 Cr.

      <p>
        MLIs used the securitization and direct assignment in raising capital
        for the business expansion purpose. Also, some of the MLIs acted as BC
        agents which to helped in business expansion without putting their
        capital into it. The securitization/ BC model is a win-win for both MLIs
        and the purchasing Banks/ FIs as it helped the lenders to build their
        priority sector portfolio. At the same times it helped the micro lenders
        to overcoming capital constraints for the business purpose and also
        provide a steady level of income through margins. It can also help in
        boosting Capital to Risk weighted Adequacy Ratio (CRAR) requirements.
        This portfolio, although managed by the MLIs themselves, will be treated
        as off balance sheet assets.
      </p>

        The MLIs in India had a total portfolio of nearly ₹79,410 Cr.,
        categorized as managed assets or off-balance sheet asset, as on 31 March
        2024, as against ₹58,984 Cr. In the previous year end. The managed
        portfolio recorded an increase of 35% for microlending institutions
        (MLIs) as a whole in FY 2023-24 and 27% was contributed only by pure
        MFIs (NBFC-MFIs, Societies, Sec. 8 Coms, Trusts and MACS or
        Cooperatives).

        Business Correspondents (BC) appointed by Banks and FIs, help in
        sourcing, managing and servicing the collections on behalf of the
        lending institutions. Initially only NGO-MFIs were allowed to be BCs,
        but later NBFC-MFIs were also allowed by RBI to act as BCs. As a result,
        more and more MLIs, especially the smaller ones, which find it difficult
        to raise funds for business, started taking up the BC route to expand
        their business and gain income. The number MLIs acting as BC agents has
        increased over the years and there were 104 such institutions as on 31
        March 2024, which recorded an increase by 28% over the previous year.
        Similarly, the number of Banks/ FIs engaging MLIs as BC agents have also

        Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra etc.) where the ATS is between
        ₹50,000 and ₹80,000. The higher ATS for these districts could be on
        account of larger presence of Banks and SFBs or their BC agents in these
        districts disbursing higher loan amount. Also, there were 19 districts
        with ATS below ₹30,000, with the districts mostly being from J&K,

      <p>
        The new regulatory framework introduced by RBI has removed the
        stipulation regarding the minimum requirement regarding the purpose for
        the micro loans. Traditionally, MLIs have been lending for both
        consumption and income generating activities. More so for productive
        purposes. The data shows that most of the borrowers are borrowing from
        MLIs for income generating activities. But a part of it could be also
        used for other needs. Overall, the purpose for borrowing as recorded by
        MLIs was for income generating activities which stood at 94% of the
        loans disbursed last year.
      </p>
      <p>
        Detailed loan usage under income generation and non-income generation
        purposes is mapped in Figure 3.21. The agriculture with 37% usage
        reported topped, followed by animal husbandry, trading and agro
        enterprises. In non-income category, loans for consumption, housing,
        education, water and sanitation and health were the major ones.
