        Keeping with the developmental outlook of MLIs, they had been involved
        in various social and developmental activities. Besides, the larger
        NBFC-MFIs have to make use of their CSR funding for this purpose. Some
        of the MLIs have formed separate Foundations or organisations to take up
        such activities. Some of the non- financial activities involved are
        training & capacity building, empowerment of the community (especially
        for women), education, financial literacy, health & sanitation,
        training, livelihood support etc. Based on the data received, Table 6.7
        gives a break-up of various categories of activities with which the MLIs
        are engaged.

          cause of uplifting less-privileged members of society by providing a

                For the benefit of the children of their borrowers and other
                community members, NOCPL has set up free after-school informal
                learning centres - Nukkad Pathshalas. Presently, 47 such centres
                (including 25 in Tamil Nadu) are being run at various locations
                in and around their operational areas, with the strength of 50
                teachers and 1,327 students. These centres aim to impart
                foundational English, Mathematics, and Science skills to
                children aged between 5 to 15 years.

                The Company&apos;s new initiative at Thiruvarur (Tamil Nadu), Nukkad
                Pathshala targeted 10th and 12th standard students with an
                extremely successful note. This centre consists of 120 students
                with teachers in English, Mathematics, Chemistry, Biology and
                Physics. Few students have performed exceedingly well in Tamil
                Nadu Board 10th & 12th std results, pass percentage being 100%

                In association with polytechnics, ITIs and other approved
                institutions/NGOs, the Company continued to arrange
                skill-building training courses for women borrowers, their
                family members and other community members. A total of 19 Tribal
                women completed a 150-day tailor- ing programme in March&apos;24
                under this arrangement with the support of a renowned NGO. While
                4 of them have already started earning by stitching blouses, the
                NGO will also assist the others in securing orders from various
                organizations and vendors. Further, 5 students have joined
                3-year Degree Courses offered by Ramakrishna Mission Vidyalaya
                through NOCPL&apos;s active association. 91% of such students who
                passed from Ramakrishna Vidyalaya during 2017 to 2023 could
                secure placements. One student earlier enrolled with renowned
                Murugappa group for free 2-year ITI course participated in CII
                Regional Work Skills Competition and thereafter secured 2nd

          Box 6.3: Community Development Initiatives – Partnering towards
          prosperity
        </h3>
        <p>
          CreditAccess India Foundation (CAIF) is the CSR wing and wholly-owned
          subsidiary of CreditAccess Grameen, India&apos;s largest microfinance
          institution. The Foundation&apos;s work spans the areas of community
          building, livelihood development, disaster relief, health, and
          environment, rooted in the belief that empowering the underserved
          spells progress for all.
        </p>
        <p>
          CAIF has a focus to improve the well-being of communities – be it
          conferring scholarships, bridging the digital divide for rural
          students, imparting skill development and vocational training programs
          for youth, constructing toilets, upgrading rural public institutions,
          or providing affordable diagnostic services for rural communities.
        </p>
        <h3>Grameen Vidya Scholarship Program:</h3>
        <p>
          One of CAIF&apos;s hallmark initiatives is &apos;Grameen Vidya&apos; – a scholarship
          program that supports underprivileged students, from government and
          aided schools, who have shown exceptional performances in their class
          10 and 11 exams. So far, the Foundation has awarded 2,200+
          scholarships with the goal to award 1,100 more scholarships this
          financial year. Through this program, they lay the groundwork for
          these students&apos; success, providing them with opportunities they
          rightly deserve.

        <h3>
          Rural Infrastructure Development – Education, Healthcare & Public
          Institutions:
        </h3>
        <p>
          Over two-thirds of India&apos;s population live in its rural areas with
          limited access to amenities, impacting their overall wellbeing. By
          strengthening its public institutions and educational capabilities,
          the Foundation works towards bridging the rural developmental divide.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Anganwadi Improvement Program recognises the significant role of
          anganwadis in rural childcare and works towards improving their
          facilities by donating baby chairs, mats and other amenities. By
          strengthening capacities of these centres, we allow them to impart
          effective welfare services for children and cement the foundation for
          their bright futures. This Financial Year, the Foundation aims to
          extend the initiative to 700 anganwadis, across 16 states and 1 union
          territory.
        </p>
        <p>
          CAIF also helps improve various pillars of rural society by
          strengthening its public institutions. The Foundation has supported
          917 institutions – including Primary Health Centres (PHCs),
          panchayats, government hospitals, primary and secondary schools –
          benefiting over 37,400 beneficiaries and various members of the
          general public. Through these initiatives, the Foundation helps rural
          communities lead secure, dignified, and healthy lives.
