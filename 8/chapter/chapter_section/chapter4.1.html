          uman resources is the greatest asset of any institution. Especially in
          a high-touch business activity like microfinance, the human resource
          and its quality plays an important role. With a large number of field
          staff, more than 60%, involved in acquisition of clients, appraisal of
          their loan application, collection of repayment amount etc. the key
          success of an institution lies on their quality, continuance and
          productivity. The sector is also slowly adopting technology and
          innovative practices wherever possible, making it more efficient and
          quicker. However, the basic services still predominantly depend on
          human resources for ensuring effective delivery.
        
      </div>
      <p>
        In microfinance sector, the predominant practice is to lend through
        groups of customers, where each one guarantees for all, through joint
        liability concept. This model was developed more than 30 years back and
        it still continues to be the most efficient and effective one, although
        in the recent days there has been some dilution in the concept. But it
        is still the strongest one. Well-functioning groups and centre meetings
        can help in bringing down cost of operation for the MLIs as the sourcing
        and collection be on an aggregated mode, and the personnel cost, which
        contribute substantially to the total expenses of MLIs, can be
        economized. It can also enhance staff productivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The staff productivity is measured through some key indicators such as
        active borrowers per credit officer (ABCO), active borrowers per MLI
        staff (ABS), amount of loan outstanding per credit officer etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the growth in the microfinance sector, there has been a steady
        growth of workforce also. As on 31st March 2024, the total workforce in
        MLIs stood at 2.87 lakh, with a growth of 33% over the previous year.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following graphs in Figure 4.1.1, illustrates three aspects, the
        growth of manpower in MLIs over the years and the distribution of staff
        between the type and size of entities.

            78% of the total workforce is employed with NBFC-MFIs. MLIs having
            outstanding portfolio of ₹2,000 Cr. and above employ 80% of the
            total workforce.

        More than sixty per cent of the staff in MLIs are in the field, working
        as branch staff, involved in business activities like sourcing,
        appraising, lending and collection. The share of women employees is
        comparatively less and constitutes only around 11% of the total
        workforce of MLIs and most of them are based in administrative offices.

        In FY 2023-24, the share of Field Staff increased to 64% with a small
        increase from 63% in the previous year.
      </p>
      <p>
        The share of women staff in MLIs has been stagnating around 10%.
        Although there was a higher number of upto 19% at one point of time, the
        share came done with growth in business and addition of more field
        staff.

        The microfinance sector provides a lot of job opportunities for the
        young educated persons in villages and semi-urban areas. Since being a
        manpower-intensive industry, there is a huge scope for new employment in
        MLIs. Above that, the higher level of attrition due to higher aspiration
        of the people leads to more opportunities in the sector.

            MLIs are a major provider of jobs especially in rural areas. In FY
            23-24, a total of 1.69 lakh staff have been recruited, there is
            growth of 36% over last year.

      <br />
      <p>
        During FY 2023-24, around 60% of the total staff were recruited afresh.
        This is due to - (i) the growth in business leading to the need for
        fresh staff which is a welcome step, and (ii) higher attrition of staff
        leading to fresh recruitment, which may not be very desirable fact.
        While some kind of attrition of staff is expected and desirable, the
        level of attrition now being witnessed in the industry is not a good
        sign. The reasons for increased level of attrition of staff are due to,
        (i) movement of staff to other institutions, especially with a number of
        new players entering into microfinance sector, (ii) the inability to
        cope up with tough rigors of microfinance industry (iii) higher
        aspirational levels of the staff (iv) opportunities offered by other
        industries
      </p>
      <p>
        (v) looking for better work life balance Table 4.1.2 shows, a total of
        1.69 lakh fresh staff were recruited by the MLIs during year, which
        forms 59% of the total strength of staff at 2.87 lakhs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Table 4.1.2 give the attrition in MLIs during FY 2023-24. The
        attrition varied between the organization from single digit to even
        100%. The higher exit of staff from the MLI leading to fresh recruitment
        and training will involve higher operational costs for the MLIs.

        As per the field-level feedback attrition has gone up significantly and
        above does not seems to reflect the same. It could be some error in data
        collection. The previous attrition had touched at 49% and in the
        reporting year, it could be more. An estimation indicates 60% attrition
        in the industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        NBFC-MFIs were the largest recruiters of staff with nearly 82% staff
        during last year. This is mainly due to their share in the total
        business growth during the year. The Non-Profit MFIs with lesser share
        in the business were able to retain most of their staff and hence the
        staff attrition was lower in these institutions, indicating that there
        is a better connect between staff and their organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Equifax India has developed an employee bureau which enables the
        MLIs to register the details of the staff recruited and those leaving
        the organization, with details of the behaviour of the staff and their
        conduct. The prompt use of this facility can prevent the frequent
        movement of staff and also avoid recruiting erring staff who have left
        on account of disciplinary cases. A verification of staff details from
        the Bureau will help prevent any wrong person from joining the MLI,
        provided all the MLIs use this facility and also upload the data timely.

        Active Borrowers per Credit Officer (ABCO) and Active Borrowers per
        staff (ABS)
      </h3>
      <p>
        The staff productivity is generally measured as a ratio of active
        borrowers to staff. The ABCO measures the number of active borrowers
        served by a Credit Officer (CO) and ABS measures active borrowers per
        staff of MLI, which includes all staff of the organisation. The ABCO
        number is significant as it determines the quantity and quality of time
        spent by the credit officer with a borrower, indicating his/her quality
        of service and productivity. With a lower ABCO ratio, the staff may be
        able to provide better service, but at a higher cost to the MLIs.
        Similarly, a very high ABCO ratio, although in terms of business, may
        look better, it can affect the quality of service and cause higher work
        burden to the staff. A proper ratio means it will able to provide better
        service and a better productivity to the company. Moreover, it will
        result in better quality of work for the staff.
      </p>
      <p>
        Diversity in the microfinance industry is also reflected in staff
        productivity levels among different MLIs. Figure 4.1.4 depicts the staff
        productivity ratios measured through Active Borrowers per Staff member
        (ABS) and Active Borrower per Credit Officer (ABCO). The staff ratio
        indicates that about 21% of MLIs have less than 100 borrowers per staff
        member, 38% have 100-200 borrowers per staff, 19% have 200-250 borrowers
        per staff, 9% have 250-300 borrowers per staff, 6% have 300-400
        borrowers per staff, and 7% have more than 400 borrowers per staff.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, 25% of MLIs have ABCO less than 200 borrowers, 26% of MLIs
        have ABCO between 200 to 300 borrowers, 21% of MLIs have ABCO between
        300 to 400 borrowers, 13% of MLIs have ABCO between 400 to 500
        borrowers, and 15% of MLIs have ABCO above 500 borrowers. There are 9
        MLIs having ABCO above 1000 which indicates that there are unrealistic
        work expectations from field staff in these institutions which can lead
        to poor portfolio quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ratio can also vary from geography based on the population and
        terrain. The MLIs needs to arrive at a reasonable number based on the
        area services and ensure better services to the client and better
        efficiency to the institution.

      <p>
        The average ABCO for 2024 stands at 380 for the whole industry, as
        against 391 in FY 2022-23. ABCO for Private & Public Limited Companies
        was the lowest among all types of institutions, at 272. The average of
        Not-for-Profit MFIs had the highest ratio at 588, due to use of SHG
        delivery model by some large MLIs like SKDRDP, followed by NBFCs (476).
        ABCO seems to be increasing with the scale of operations.

        4.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Distribution of MLIs Based on Loan Portfolio per Credit
        Officer
      </h2>
      <p>
        In addition to the number of clients serviced by credit officers, the
        amount of loans handled by them is also an important measure that
        contributes to staff productivity. Figure 4.1.7 presents the
        distribution of MLIs across various bands of loan portfolio handled by
        each credit officer. About 12% of MLIs have credit officers handling a
        loan portfolio of less than ₹20 lakh, 11% of MLIs have a range of ₹20-40
        lakh loan portfolio per credit officer, 15% of MLIs have a range of
        ₹40-60 lakh loan portfolio per credit officer, 16% of MLIs have a range
        of ₹60-80 lakh loan portfolio per credit officer, 11% of MLIs have a
        range of ₹80-100 lakh loan portfolio per credit officer, and 35% of MLIs
        have loan officers handling a portfolio worth more than ₹100 lakh.
      </p>
      <p>
        The amount handled by the Credit Officer will also depend on the stage
        of JLG/SHG in his/her area of operation and the size of loan being
        disbursed. So long as there are proper remittance facilities available
        or switching to digital repayment, it may not be of great concern.
        However, any case of excess loan accounts can impact the quality of
        service and collection efficiency.
