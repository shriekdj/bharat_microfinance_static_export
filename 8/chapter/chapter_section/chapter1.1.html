          he global economy continues to be uncertain and volatile with
          geopolitical uncertainties due to conflicts as well as disruption in
          shipping routes. The global inflation, while marginally down is still
          above the targeted rate. Global growth has shrunk due to tight
          monetary policies. This of course affects India and the Indian
          economy. While the Indian economy has shown greater resilience, and we
          have had a third consecutive year of 7%+ growth in GDP, the inflation
          continues to be higher than the targeted band and the monetary policy
          approach is not easing. We should look at the inclusive finance space
          in the larger picture.
      </div>
      <p>
        In general, the inclusive finance markets are expected to be inelastic,
        insulated from volatility and stable. That is because the loan amounts
        are small and therefore might not be very price sensitive. When we say
        that the inclusive finance markets are not price sensitive, we allude to
        the fact that a few basis points movement in interest rates do not make
        an absolute and material difference in the livelihoods and household
        economy of the poor, because of the very marginal change this rate would
        have on the absolute cost. A reduction of interest rates from 20% per
        annum to 19.5% per annum will not make a difference in the weekly or
        monthly instalment payment of the poor household if the amount borrowed
        is say ₹50,000. At best it would make a difference of about ₹20 on a
        monthly instalment.
      </p>
      <p>
        While global volatility ideally should not have a major impact on the
        inclusive finance market, we need to recognise that inflation affects
        the poor disproportionately. That is because the poor would have lesser
        proportion of their expense as discretionary expenditure and when a
        sizeable percentage of the income is spent on non-negotiable essentials,
        then, inflation could be killing the poor households. We need to assess
        the overall health of the economy in which the poor operate considering
        how the volatility of global and domestic markets results in inflation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The news on inflation is mixed. While there have been positive signs in
        reigning in inflation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has not been
        convinced that it is moving southwards fast enough towards target rate
        of 4% or even the upper bound limit of 6%. As a result, we see that the
        MPC has kept the repo rates constant for over a year, with the voting
        being overwhelmingly favouring the stance (see Chart below) (Reserve
        Bank of India, 2024).

        This is a worrying factor for the poorer segments. This is also worrying
        because of food inflation which hurts the poor disproportionately. The
        climate events have become regular and erratic. The heat wave during the
        first quarter of this fiscal has had some negative impact on the
        microfinance sector. The monsoon has been good with more than above
        average rainfall across the country. But there are pockets where rains
        were deficit and some areas with flooding. There are points of stress
        that we see in the buffer stocks of essential grain and pulses and the
        ensuing year is likely to be stressful to the poor. While global
        volatility may not affect the inclusive finance portfolio, the
        inflation, monsoon, other climate events and food prices may result in a
        stress on the quality of the loan portfolio of the inclusive finance
        institutions which have been having a great run for multiple years
        braving many crises.

        The redeeming features of the welfare architecture will try to blunt the
        negative effects of the larger economic pain points. Increased wage
        employment under MGNREGA (increased from ₹60,000 crores in the 2023- 24
        Budget estimates to ₹86,000 crores in the 2024-25 budget estimates) will
        pump in money to the rural households that makes their cash flows
        better. In addition, the supply of free rations under the Right to Food
        Act, the reduction of power bills due to roll out of solar panels and
        waiver of power bills in some states, the welfare payments made to women
        in States like Karnataka and other benefit transfers ensure that the
        households either are getting some positive cash flows or there has been
        a reduction in cash outflows. These, welfare payments will provide an
        insulation for the inclusive finance loans. The challenge for the
        inclusive finance sector is to watch out the stress that comes out of
        inflation, particularly food inflation and the relief that comes from
        direct benefit transfers. Therefore, one would assume that the ensuing
        year may not be a year of aggressive growth.
