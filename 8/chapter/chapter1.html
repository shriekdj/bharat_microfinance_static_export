        he global economy continues to be uncertain and volatile with
        geopolitical uncertainties due to conflicts as well as disruption in
        shipping routes. The global inflation, while marginally down is still
        above the targeted rate. Global growth has shrunk due to tight
        monetary policies. This of course affects India and the Indian
        economy. While the Indian economy has shown greater resilience, and we
        have had a third consecutive year of 7%+ growth in GDP, the inflation
        continues to be higher than the targeted band and the monetary policy
        approach is not easing. We should look at the inclusive finance space
        in the larger picture.
      
    </div>
    <p>
      In general, the inclusive finance markets are expected to be inelastic,
      insulated from volatility and stable. That is because the loan amounts
      are small and therefore might not be very price sensitive. When we say
      that the inclusive finance markets are not price sensitive, we allude to
      the fact that a few basis points movement in interest rates do not make
      an absolute and material difference in the livelihoods and household
      economy of the poor, because of the very marginal change this rate would
      have on the absolute cost. A reduction of interest rates from 20% per
      annum to 19.5% per annum will not make a difference in the weekly or
      monthly instalment payment of the poor household if the amount borrowed
      is say ₹50,000. At best it would make a difference of about ₹20 on a
      monthly instalment.
    </p>
    <p>
      While global volatility ideally should not have a major impact on the
      inclusive finance market, we need to recognise that inflation affects
      the poor disproportionately. That is because the poor would have lesser
      proportion of their expense as discretionary expenditure and when a
      sizeable percentage of the income is spent on non-negotiable essentials,
      then, inflation could be killing the poor households. We need to assess
      the overall health of the economy in which the poor operate considering
      how the volatility of global and domestic markets results in inflation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news on inflation is mixed. While there have been positive signs in
      reigning in inflation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has not been
      convinced that it is moving southwards fast enough towards target rate
      of 4% or even the upper bound limit of 6%. As a result, we see that the
      MPC has kept the repo rates constant for over a year, with the voting
      being overwhelmingly favouring the stance (see Chart below) (Reserve
      Bank of India, 2024).

      This is a worrying factor for the poorer segments. This is also worrying
      because of food inflation which hurts the poor disproportionately. The
      climate events have become regular and erratic. The heat wave during the
      first quarter of this fiscal has had some negative impact on the
      microfinance sector. The monsoon has been good with more than above
      average rainfall across the country. But there are pockets where rains
      were deficit and some areas with flooding. There are points of stress
      that we see in the buffer stocks of essential grain and pulses and the
      ensuing year is likely to be stressful to the poor. While global
      volatility may not affect the inclusive finance portfolio, the
      inflation, monsoon, other climate events and food prices may result in a
      stress on the quality of the loan portfolio of the inclusive finance
      institutions which have been having a great run for multiple years
      braving many crises.
    </p>
    <p>
      The redeeming features of the welfare architecture will try to blunt the
      negative effects of the larger economic pain points. Increased wage
      employment under MGNREGA (increased from ₹60,000 crores in the 2023- 24
      Budget estimates to ₹86,000 crores in the 2024-25 budget estimates) will
      pump in money to the rural households that makes their cash flows
      better. In addition, the supply of free rations under the Right to Food
      Act, the reduction of power bills due to roll out of solar panels and
      waiver of power bills in some states, the welfare payments made to women
      in States like Karnataka and other benefit transfers ensure that the
      households either are getting some positive cash flows or there has been
      a reduction in cash outflows. These, welfare payments will provide an
      insulation for the inclusive finance loans. The challenge for the
      inclusive finance sector is to watch out the stress that comes out of
      inflation, particularly food inflation and the relief that comes from
      direct benefit transfers. Therefore, one would assume that the ensuing
      year may not be a year of aggressive growth.

    <h2 style="font-size: x-large" id="the_changing_ecosystem_of_inclusive_finance">
      1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;The changing ecosystem of inclusive finance
    </h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      The past year was also a year of relief for the inclusive finance sector
      and possibly an indication of stability of operations and maturity in
      understanding of what the intervention is all about. The intense
      political activity due to general elections, the unfavourable climate
      impact and some kind over leverage in certain pockets have some negative
      on the microfinance and inclusive finance space. Having braved multiple
      crises in Kolar, Nizamabad and Krishna districts, and more recently the
      Assam crisis, we may assume that the sector has come of age and
      stabilised. There were no tensions about the political activity and the
      activity continue business-as-usual frame. There were no significant
      structural changes, during the past year and there does not seem to be
      any fundamental changes soon. How do we read this stability in the
      ecosystem, institutional design, product design and delivery of
      financial services to the poor and excluded?
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be time for us to take stock of the situation to understand this
      stability and mark the significant events that have led us to this
      stage. We also should read the tea leaves to see the possibilities and
      fissures of the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us look at the most significant events in the past and recognise how
      the inclusive finance sector has fundamentally changed and what it means
      as we go forward in terms of operations. The concept of a solidarity
      groups was put to test during the demonetisation phase, when different
      members of solidarity groups got affected differently. This was an
      inflexion point, which compromised on the group solidarity to getting
      individuals to pay their dues. While the trigger was demonetisation, we
      also must recognise that the ecosystem had evolved. The group solidarity
      was needed because of information asymmetry between the lender and the
      borrower. But with credit bureaus emerging effectively, a significant
      part of the formal indebtedness of the borrower was now getting
      captured. The credit bureau score turned out to be a fairly powerful
      weapon that worked in two ways: it helped the lender to take a call
      based on the score, and it also helped in recovery – where the lender
      could convince the borrower the importance of maintaining a decent
      credit score in order to have a continued relationship. But there are
      also concerns of some lending done in the same space microfinance is not
      getting captured in the credit buraus. The group mechanism, one
      fundamental purpose of the group – that of providing round-robin
      guarantee was watered down. However, the other fundamental purpose of
      the group – the aggregation of transactions and the regularity of the
      meeting still continued although in a much diluted manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      In making this observation it is important to clarify that we are
      restricting the note to the JLG type of inclusive finance, while the
      self-help groups worked on an ex-ante basis. The SHG architecture has
      remained warped in time and embedded in the rural livelihoods
      architecture of the State. While it is important to recognise their work
      and how they impact the overall ecosystem, in the context of the Bharat
      Microfinance Report and the functions undertaken by an organisation like
      Sa-Dhan, the details of the SHG ecosystem would not be particularly
      important. While there are significant attempts to computerise the SHG
      records (with the initiative of NABARD) and to upload the SHG data on to
      the credit bureaus, there are still gaps in the journey since the
      individual records have not completely been de-duplicated. Moreover, the
      SHG bank linkage has been now fully taken over by the DAY-NRLM and it
      has been become as the flagship programme for livelihood and enterprises
      for poor. This would further get a boost with the implementation of
      Lakhpati Didi scheme of GOI, where the women borrowers would be
      supported to graduate into larger business activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, the larger shifts that we are discussing is in the context of
      the JLG type of inclusive finance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second major shift that happened in the design of the JLG system
      happened because of the Covid 19 pandemic, where the activity continued,
      even without the need for the groups to meet. While in significant parts
      of the ecosystem, meetings continue to happen for aggregation of
      transactions and regularity, this is no longer the non-negotiable piece
      in the design.
    </p>
    <p>
      With technological advances, it is possible to move to digital payments
      and repayments. There are still challenges because of multiple factors:
      (a) women may not have smartphones or handsets mapped exclusively to
      their account; (b) women are nervous because there is no “touch and
      feel” for the transaction. However, this is an area that is open to
      significant intervention through literacy and education.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the digital payments and repayments become ubiquitous, then the
      need for the group meeting would be reduced to (a) socialisation and (b)
      regularity of contact with the customer. This change would affect the
      way the inclusive finance sector is currently operating. However, these
      changes will not be immediate and drastic, but there will be a movement
      towards embracing technology. It is important for the players in the
      sector to anticipate and make investments not only in hardware and
      software, but also in training and awareness programmes.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are fundamental changes in the operating model of inclusive
      finance. As more people get included, it would be important for the
      sector to deepen the engagement with the clients. The regulation has
      provided for a possibility of increasing the exposure to these families
      by increasing the limits in defining microfinance loans and exposures.
      However, if the engagement with the customers must be deepened, then it
      will have to move towards individual loans. Several organisations
      already have individual loans, but these are offered through the
      signalling of group mechanisms. The way the deepening of the exposure is
      undertaken is through regular increase in exposure limits, based on
      credit scores and past performance with the organisation. This is the
      weakness in the inclusive finance model. The architecture of assessment
      of individual loans through understanding the client cash flows is
      limiting. The group model relied on the embedded knowledge of the group
      members and their honour to ensure repayments. But as we go to a low
      touch, technology enabled, individual model then organisations must be
      careful and develop adequate capabilities at the credit officer level on
      assessments.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the level of data improves and recording and codification of
      transactions increases, the reliance of embedded knowledge of the groups
      would not be as critical and one could continue the relationship based
      on extant knowledge and experience. However, the framework under which
      this model operates needs a reset in the learnings and lived experience
      of credit officers. As we go forward this would be the major challenge
      to the inclusive finance organisations. Excessive reliance on data is
      also amenable to lending on an involuntary framework. What we mean by
      involuntary framework is that the loans would be pushed through offers
      based on the models developed based on transaction data. This would be
      imperative as more data get captured through digital transactions
      including UPI. If this phenomenon picks up, the biggest players in the
      market would be FinTech. How the legacy microfinance institutions cope
      with the data driven fintech is to be seen. The legacy microfinance
      institutions have something that the fintech do not have – presence on
      ground and feet on street. The new microfinance model will have to blend
      the strength of data with the field presence, to undertake responsible,
      need based lending rather than data driven push of loan products.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2 style="font-size: x-large" id="institutional_architecture_for_inclusive_finance">
      1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Institutional architecture for inclusive finance
    </h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      Some aspects of the institutional architecture are interesting to note.
      There have been no significant fresh players who have been granted the
      banking licence either as a small finance bank or universal bank. The
      regulatory burden of a bank does not suit the light touch agile model of
      MLIs. Even within the first set of microfinance institutions that became
      banks, the exuberance is muted, with already one organisation merging
      with an SFB that was originally an asset financing NBFC. Even the other
      large MLIs have taken the route of being taken over by banks to be used
      as non-banking subsidiaries (sourcing loans for the bank balance sheet)
      or have become divisions of large NBFCs. This is a phenomenon to note.
      The microfinance market has significant headroom to grow – both in terms
      of adding new clients and deepening the engagement with existing
      clients. This growth needs adequate amount of risk capital which can be
      provided by large, listed, well established groups who are taking the
      MLIs over as a part of their market expansion and the strategy of not
      leaving any white marks.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the structure of an SFB which requires the banks to have a
      microfinance like portfolio (licencing conditions of priority sector
      loans and cap on loan size for 75% of the portfolio) and largely
      unsecured, with a bank-level regulatory compliance and capital infusion
      that has more stringent levels of capitalisation for unsecured portfolio
      and constant benchmarking with other banks. This has created a stress
      and a dichotomy in the microfinance (particularly the NBFC-MFI sector).
      It may be a good idea for RBI to look at the licencing conditions if
      they want more financial institutions to apply in the SFB space.
    </p>
    <p>
      The biggest play that is emerging is in the Fintech sector.
      Organisations like NAVI which looked at infusing digital technology in a
      big way to the banking sector was not given a licence. NAVI exited the
      inclusive finance space and moved on to be a technology-driven NBFC.
      This gives us two important signals: (1) The regulator is not willing to
      experiment with radically different models in banking, while happy to be
      undertaking incremental changes in the regulatory architecture and (2)
      Fintech is not about financial inclusion. While the inclusive customers
      could be a subset of Fintech and P2P models, we should assume that those
      models have an economic logic of their own and move beyond financial
      inclusion. The newly announced Unified Lending Interface (ULI) on the
      lines United Payment Interface (UPI) is something to be watched for the
      future. But it may take a while to stabilize and get the kind result, we
      are looking for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, there is still adequate space for the institutions to operate
      as NBFC-MFI and other not-for-profit formats as they are. The sector
      needs to be updated on the technology-led challenges and competition
      emerging from the FinTech, embed closely with the banking sector and
      look at leveraging the technology and blending it with the touch they
      have with the customers. MLIs would have an advantage over fintech, as
      they embrace technology, but still are able to avoid involuntary loan
      push models and respond to demand pull models. As the boundaries between
      organisational forms break down and delivery models become seamless, it
      will be good for customers who will have access to a suite of mainstream
      and regulated financial services. It will be a little bit of a problem
      for researchers and analysts as data that would emanate from individual
      delivery models will not be easily available as they get embedded into
      portfolios of larger providers. That is a cost worth paying.

      In Conclusion, a few bullets that could be fired:
    </h3>
    <ul class="b">
      <li class="b">
        Inflation, uncertainty in global shipping lines, uncertain local
        monsoons would affect the economy, but persistent inflation will
        affect the inclusive finance customers and may push the portfolio
        towards stress.
      </li>

      <li class="b">
        Greater amounts of benefit transfers and welfare programmes will blunt
        the ill effect of global and domestic headwinds, but it is important
        to watch for stress in the client ecosystem.
      </li>

      <li class="b">
        The fundamental delivery models are gradually changing, and this needs
        to be recognised, acknowledged and serious retooling of delivery
        models based on risk appetite needs to be re-imagined.
      </li>

      <li class="b">
        The SHG model needs a significant re-look on how they could be
        embedded in the mainstream banking system and credit bureau reporting
        system more tightly. The Lakhpati Didi scheme is something which is
        giving a hope for the SHG model to take this programme to the next
        level.
      </li>

      <li class="b">
        Technology is on the horizon and is pushing algorithm based
        involuntary lending models to the urban middle class and salaried
        people and it will not be long before the data of the poor is also
        accessed to push loans. This is a red flag for the existing players
        with customer touch. Competing with impersonal involuntary push models
        and providing voluntary pull products will be a challenge that the
        microfinance sector must face.
      </li>

      <li class="b">
        The institutional architecture debate is settled with openness towards
        technology-led models but reservations towards highly regulated
        banking models. The element of innovation that is involved requires
        light regulation.
      </li>

      <li class="b">
        The coming year might have two stress points: portfolio level stress
        due to inflation and performance of the economy and technology-led
        disruption due to fast and unbridled growth of FinTech.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As Sa-Dhan has completed 25 years of existence, we can safely say that
      the inclusive finance model has arrived and has been adequately
      mainstreamed. The report will reflect that fact.

        Box 1.1: Women Entrepreneurship Livelihood Enhancement and Development
        (WE-LEAD)
      </h3>
      <p style="font-weight: bold">Context</p>
      <p>
        In India, women-led enterprises face several barriers to scaling up,
        particularly when it comes to accessing formal finance. While
        initiatives like Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and Joint Liability Groups
        (JLGs) have provided a foundation, women entrepreneurs still struggle
        to transform microenterprises into larger, more sustainable
        businesses. Data from the Ministry of MSME shows that only 20.4% of
        microenterprises, 5.3% of small enterprises, and 2.7% of medium
        enterprises are owned by women, highlighting the need for targeted
        interventions that address training, capacity building, and financial
        access. The “Women Entrepreneurship Livelihood Enhancement and
        Development (WE-LEAD)” project, supported by SIDBI, is a 24-month
        comprehensive initiative aimed at empowering women entrepreneurs in
        Tamil Nadu and Gujarat. Recognizing the gender disparity within the
        MSME sector, where only 20% of MSMEs are owned by women, this project
        seeks to close the gap and leverage financial institutions to catalyze
        economic growth. By focusing on underrepresented women entrepreneurs,
        WE-LEAD strives to move beyond subsistence livelihoods toward
        sustainable economic empowerment.
      </p>

        from scaling up. By offering tailored training, financial linkages,
        and post- training support, the project is empowering women
        entrepreneurs to move beyond subsistence livelihoods toward
        sustainable economic growth. In particular, the project’s alignment
        with initiatives like Lakhpati Didi, which focuses on enabling SHG
        members to achieve sustainable income levels, strengthens its impact.
        WE- LEAD contributes to building long-term resilience and economic
        empowerment. While notable progress will be made, especially in
        mobilizing women entrepreneurs and facilitating credit access,
        continuous hand holding, capacity building, and strategic support
        remain crucial to fully achieving the project’s goals.
